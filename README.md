# DCDL player

This project aims to provide a tool to play CountDown (*i.e.* Des Chiffres et Des Lettres, *aka* DCDL), the famous TV show.

It is far from being completed, if you have any suggestion, do not hesitate to contribute!

## Functionalities

+ the longest word
+ the good count

### The longest word

Starting from a draw of ten letters, the player has to find the longest word.

### The good count

With the help of six numbers, the player has to reach a seventh number. The first six numbers are chosen amongst the following ones: 1 to 10, 25, 50, 75, 100. The result is between 100 and 999.

## Issues

+ Find a open-source reference dictionnary
+ Design the good count algorithm
